**Update: Thanks for showing so much interest but unfortunately, there are no more spaces available.**

As part of Silicon Valley comes to the UK ([www.svc2uk.com](http://www.svc2uk.com/)), we will be hosting an evening in DoC, called "Silicon Valley comes to Imperial". We shall be having successful entrepreneurs from the Valley sharing their experiences and will have a networking opportunity as well.


If you are interested in helping out  as a volunteer please reply to this email by this evening. Volunteers just need to be there a few hours before the event and get access to meeting these entrepreneurs on a more personal basis as well as an invitation to a private dinner. Places will go on a first come first serve basis.
