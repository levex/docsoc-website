Feedback is really important. Many people in labs express ideas, some of them are great and brilliant some of them are crazy and not feasible. But it’s very hard to distinguish one group from another.

Nevertheless we believe that you have ideas that will make Imperial DoC best computing department in the world. So we are launching DoCSoc Ideas Forum!
