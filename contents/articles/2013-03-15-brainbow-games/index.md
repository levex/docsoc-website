Talks were given by Bertrand Lamarque one of the developers for SimCity and Xavier Louis (Ex Playfish Product Management)
They together gave us a very interesting lecture about Game as a service. Also what they think would be the ideal makeup for a game development team.

The second talk was about the company brainbow games. Their [past products](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id539359333) and their current work in progress. Their talk culminated with a Q &amp; A session where they talked about their experiences in the industry and also some of the setbacks of recent launches and what they thought some of the games lacked.


They are also looking for interns, to get more information check their [website](http://www.brainbowgames.com/jobs/)
