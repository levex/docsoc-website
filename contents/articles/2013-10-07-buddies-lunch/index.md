This year's buddies (or 'Mums and Dads') lunch was a great success with over 180 students attending.

The annual buddies lunch is designed to connect new students with students in higher years, as a point of contact during the first few weeks and the first year.

The event is funded each year by the department (who provided a sandwich lunch and drinks) and DocSoc, who provided lots of pizza from Dominos.
